# Added because some of the output lines in tests exceed the default max_width
# and without this setting, rustfmt fails with the following message:
#
#   error[internal]: left behind trailing whitespace
#
# This makes it seem like rustfmt is broken when it really just doesn't know how
# to deal with long strings of text.
max_width = 300
